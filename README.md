We are using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/) to generate the pages of
the site. Reading the linked documentation should teach you enough to change any
part of the site.

**To write posts** make new post in the ``_posts`` directory. Posts may be
written in html, markdown, or any of the other formatting engines that Jekyll
supports. You **must** begin the file with the following:

    ---
    layout: post
    title:  "Post Title Goes Here"
    date:   2015-11-24 11:11:11 -0800
    author: "Your Name"
    categories: categoryName
