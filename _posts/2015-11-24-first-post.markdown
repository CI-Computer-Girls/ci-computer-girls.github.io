Hi Everyone, welcome to the CI Computer Girls website!

As you can tell, this web page is still under construction and instead of hiding this, we’re happy to share our work in progress with you.

Over the past semester, the officers of the club have gotten together and discussed the necessity of having a place to post our agendas, calendars, and interesting blog posts without having to go through the cumbersome process of logging into CI Sync.

Therefore we’re excited to be developing this collaborative space not just for logistical information regarding the club, but also fun things that will allow us to grow greater as a community.

We’re aware that this is an amazing opportunity to have your voices in heard in what you’d like to see on the webpage, therefore If you’re interested in helping out the effort, find us at:

<https://github.com/CI-Computer-Girls/ci-computer-girls.github.io.git>

Happy coding!

\- Winter Smith
