CI Computer Girls is a club dedicated to encouraging and empowering young women to enter the field of Computer Science. 
We are now over 25 members strong and growing rapidly with each semester.
Our mission is to not only enrich and support young women on campus here at California State University Channel Islands, but also to extend our knowledge to young women in our community. 

CI Computer Girls membership is extended to both men and women, persons from all walks of life are welcome!
